## JIRA Project
To ease TAP development and use, a JIRA project for TAP has been created.  

> See https://trustedanalytics.atlassian.net to submit issues/requests now.

This JIRA project allows you to:
* Enter defects for platform components
* See all open and resolved defects for the project
* See the list of all open change/feature requests
* Create change/feature requests

In the future, the JIRA project will also contain information about upcoming releases.

You can view JIRA entries as an anonymous user (you don't need to register as a user in the project JIRA for this).

However, to create JIRA items (defects, change requests, etc.) you will need to register as a user in the project JIRA.

## Contribution to the project
If you want to contribute to project, to see all defects and features, and/or to enter new issues, register as follows:

1. Visit https://trustedanalytics.atlassian.net
1. Click the **Log in** button in upper right corner.
1. Click on the **Create an account** link.
1. Follow the instructions on the page to establish your credentials.  
 
Once you log in using your new credentials, you can see all issues and create new ones.

### Entering new defect on JIRA project
Entering a new defect to Trusted Analytics means you create an issue in JIRA project that describes that issue. This is easily done using the **Create** button on the main menu bar at the top of the page.

To enter a new defect, follow these steps:

1. Click the **Create** button at the top of the page. JIRA opens a **Create issue** form.
1. Set the **Project** dropdown menu to **TrustedAnalytics(TRACS)** and the **Issue Type** dropdown menu to **bug**.
1. Enter a summary of the issue in the **Summary** field and more descriptive explanation of the defect in the **Bug Description** field.
1. You can also attach files to help describe the issue.
1. If you are familiar with JIRA, you can fill other fields as well. Otherwise, leave them as they are.
1. Click the **Create** button at the bottom of the **Create issue** form.

Congratulations! You just created a new defect in JIRA project and became a contributor to the Trusted Analytics Platform.
