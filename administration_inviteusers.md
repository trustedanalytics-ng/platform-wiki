The TAP user interface allows system admins to invite new users to the platform along with a request to create an organization. (For information on inviting users to existing organizations and spaces, [go here](https://github.com/trustedanalytics/platform-wiki-0.8/0.7-Managing-organizations-spaces-and-users).)

# Inviting a user to the platform

To invite a new user to the platform, perform the following steps:

1. Log into TAP as system admin.

9. Navigate to **User Management** and choose the **Onboarding** tab.

9. Enter the e-mail address of the user you want to invite and click **Send invitation**.

Invited users receive an email with a link to the registration page, where they specify their own password and create/name their own organization.
