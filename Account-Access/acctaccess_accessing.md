This page shows you how to respond to an initial TAP platform invitation. It also covers ongoing TAP login.

## Initial user access to platform

Initial access to the *platform* is available only by invitation from a system admin. Contact your system admin for a platform invitation. 

After receiving the email invite and clicking on the link in the email, you will land on the registration page below.

Enter your password choice (twice), select the **Terms of Service** checkbox, and click **Create account**. (It's a good idea to read the Terms of Service.)

TAP creates your platform account and gives you access to the single platform organization.

TAP then displays a confirmation screen (shown below). Click on the login link in the confirmation screen to log into the platform. (Remember to save the login link for future use.)
