##Adding users to the organization

> System admins can add users to the platform. If the user does *not* already have a user account on the platform, TAP generates an invitation email to the user.

Here are the steps to invite a user to the platform: 

1. Navigate to **User Management > Manage Organization Users**.

2. Choose the **Add user** tab.

3. Enter the email address of the user you wish to add.

4. Choose between the **Regular User** and **Organizational Admin** roles. (Most users will likely be **Regular Users**.)

5. Click the **Add user** button.

If the user does *not* yet have a TAP account, TAP sends an email invitation to the user. For the user view of this process, visit [Account access](/Account-Access/acctaccess_accessing.md).

##Deleting users from the organization

> System admins can delete users from the single platform organization.

Here are the steps to delete a user from the organization:

1. Navigate to **User Management > Manage Organization Users**.

2. Choose the **User list** tab.

3. Click the **x** (delete symbol) next to user you wish to delete (right side of screen).

4. Confirm the deletion.

5. TAP deletes the user from the organization and displays a confirmation message in the upper right of the screen. Refresh your browser after several seconds to see the deletion reflected on the screen.

##Changing user roles

You can change the role for an existing user as follows:

1. Navigate to **User Management > Manage Organization Users**.

9. Choose the **User list** tab.

9. Check/uncheck the **Organization Admin** checkbox for the user whose role you want to change:  
  
    * Checked = Organization Admin  
    * Unchecked = Regular User
