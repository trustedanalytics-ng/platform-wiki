##Adding users to the organization

> System admins can add users to the single platform organization. If the user does *not* already have a user account on the platform, TAP generates an invitation email to the user.

Here are the steps to invite a user to the single platform organization: 

1. Navigate to **User Management > Manage Organization Users**.

2. Choose the **Add user** tab.

3. Enter the email address of the user you wish to add.

4. Choose between the **Regular User** and **Organizational Admin** roles. (Most users will likely be **Regular Users**.)

5. Click the **Add user** button.

For existing platform users, TAP will notify you that the user has been added to the organization. But *you must notify the user* of this addition, as TAP does *not* send any notifications.

If the user does *not* yet have a TAP account, TAP sends an email invitation to the user. For the user view of this process, [go here](/Account-Access/acctaccess_accessing.md).

##Deleting users from the organization

> System admins can delete users from the single platform organization.

Here are the steps to delete a user from the organization:

1. Navigate to **User Management > Manage Organization Users**.

2. Choose the **Add user** tab.

3. Click the **x** (delete symbol) next to user you wish to delete.

4. Confirm the deletion.

5. TAP deletes the user from the organization and displays a confirmation message in the upper right of the screen. Refresh your browser after several seconds to see the deletion reflected on the screen.

>This only deletes the user from the organization; their user account still exists at the platform level.
