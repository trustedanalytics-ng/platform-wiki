##Information about Trusted Platform Analytics Licences

Trusted Analytics Platform (TAP) is an open-source project and all the public repositories in 'trustedanalytics' GitHub org are released under the [Apache Software License](https://www.apache.org/licenses/), Version 2.0. The TAP project uses the Apache license to distribute software and documentation.

TAP incorporates many open-source technologies, integrating them in one platform. For user convenience, TAP downloads and installs some of these open-source components from their respective official download sites as part of the TAP installation.

>For example, [[CDH|http://www.cloudera.com/content/cloudera/en/products-and-services/cdh.html]] is the open source distribution of Apache Hadoop and related projects from [[Cloudera|http://www.cloudera.com/]].  For CDH technical support, professional services, training and [[Cloudera|http://www.cloudera.com/]] products, please contact [[Cloudera|http://www.cloudera.com/]].
