## Creating a Service Instance

1. Search for and select the service you want. (Yarn has been chosen for this example, but these steps apply to any service available in the Marketplace).

1. From the service details page, choose the plan needed, then enter a name for your new service instance in the field to the left of the **Create new instance** button.

    1. If a key-value pair is needed as a parameter for the service, click on **+ Add an extra parameter** to show the  fields for one Key-Value pair. Enter the key and value. (You can click the link again to add another key-value pair. You can also remove a key-value pair by clicking the **x** symbol after a pair.)
1. Click the **Create new instance** button to begin the process for creating an instance of the service you selected and named. (The button is *not* available until you input a name for your instance.) 

When the install process completes, your instance will be included in the “Running instances ” table at the bottom of the service details page.
