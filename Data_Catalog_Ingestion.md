2.	Select the tab **Submit Transfer**.
3.	Choose **Link** to input a URL to a data set _or_ **Local Path** to activate a “Choose File” file browser button, which opens your local file directory browser.  _The upload button will not be active until a file has been chosen or a URL provided._

4.	Enter a title in the form field labeled “title for link…” _The upload button will not be active until a title has been provided._ 
5.	Select a category to help others find your data easily. (**Other** is the default.)
6.	Select the Upload button.

It may take 30 seconds to a couple of minutes, depending on the size of the data file you are ingesting. Your data set will now be listed in the **Data Catalog>Data sets** tab.
